## Laptop A — Miguel

**Baseline** — branch `main`, last verified commit `83a2c5b`, working tree clean and pushed to `origin/main`.

### Active task

_None. Nothing in progress._

### What's done (current state — not a history)

- Rail Sidebar panel resize (`react-resizable-panels`) ships with correct shadow clearance on all four
  sides and no height regression (L-35/L-36/L-37, see `limbo-factory/src/data/rail-sidebar.ts` and
  `LIMBO-PROTOCOL-LOG.md` Update 9/10).
- Factory-line preview stage (`limbo-factory/src/App.tsx`) anchors the Rail+Panel composite
  (`justify-start`) instead of centering it, fixing the Rail being almost entirely clipped (L-38, see
  `limbo-factory/src/data/rail-sidebar.ts` and `LIMBO-PROTOCOL-LOG.md` Update 11). User-confirmed live.

### What's next

_Nothing queued. Awaiting new instructions._

### Open questions / blockers

_None._

## Laptop B — Blair

**Baseline** — branch `main`, last verified commit `a984c7b`, working tree clean and pushed to `origin/main`.

### Active task

_None. Nothing in progress._

### What's done (current state — not a history)

- **A-6 clear (X) button** shipped in two places: `CommandInput` (`src/ui/command.tsx`) gains a trailing
  clear button (reserved 24×24 `icon-xs` slot, hidden via `aria-hidden`/`tabIndex={-1}`/`invisible` so
  there's no layout shift, clears via the native `<input>` value setter + dispatched `input` event, `Escape`
  clears first and `stopPropagation()`s so it doesn't bubble into a parent `CommandDialog`); and a new
  general-purpose `SearchInput` primitive (`src/ui/search-input.tsx`, exported from `src/index.ts`, built
  from `InputGroup`/`InputGroupAddon`/`InputGroupInput`/`InputGroupButton`, showcased at
  `site/src/routes/components/SearchInputShowcase.tsx`). `SearchInput`'s `className` prop sizes the outer
  `InputGroup` (the actual visible box); `inputClassName` targets the inner `<input>` only. Verified:
  root+`site/` typecheck/build clean, hover→filled icon swap confirmed live via Playwright against both dev
  server and a real production/minified `vite preview` build, disabled-state propagation confirmed live.
- **Rail Sidebar Limbo transformation (`limbo-factory/`) — category F ("Layout / Sizing") fully closed.**
  All 11 rows (F-1 through F-11) are `status: "resolved"`, the first category in the divergence list to
  reach a full, uniform resolved state. Key resolutions: F-3 (`panelW` default 256px/min 240px,
  cross-checked against `min-w-60`), F-4 (`panelGap` 8px, cross-checked against `SidebarInset`'s own
  `m-2`), F-5/F-6 (unified ALL nav row heights — rail buttons, panel-tree rows/groups at every nesting
  depth, footer icons — to a single `h-8`/32px, eliminating three previously-separate row-height numbers so
  the rail and panel read as one consistent system regardless of depth), F-7 (footer 3-icon cap: the
  `122px` `FOOTER_MAX_HEIGHT` was genuinely NOT wired into code before this work — now implemented via
  `overflow-hidden` + inline `maxHeight` on the footer's flex column, derived from bidezine's own real
  `size-[38px]` rail buttons + `gap-1` spacing, not copied from origin's literal), F-8/F-9/F-11 (panel
  min-width, derived item-slot sizing, footer bottom-anchoring — all confirmed live in code, no changes
  needed), F-10 (rail must fill its container's height — a documentation-only deployment note confirming
  the real Build should use `h-full`/CSS sizing rather than the preview-tool-specific measured-height prop
  `limbo-factory`'s own `App.tsx`/`FillHeight` uses; no code change needed in `limbo-factory` itself). Full
  rationale for every row: `limbo-factory/src/data/rail-sidebar.ts` (rows F-1–F-11) and
  `LIMBO-PROTOCOL-LOG.md` (Updates 12–18, append-only). `CLAUDE.md`'s Primitive Fidelity Checklist item 26
  gained a fourth verification axis: an approved divergence-row CONCEPT is not the same as it being wired
  into real code — always re-check the live component source when a row moves to `"resolved"` (this caught
  F-7's implementation gap). Remaining open categories in the Rail Sidebar divergence list: H (motion), I
  (elevation), J (z-index), L (component gaps, 1 open item), M (naming/API conflicts) — 12 rows total, none
  touched this baseline.
- **Machine-identity protocol added**: `.env.example` now documents `MACHINE_NAME`/`MACHINE_OWNER`; the
  `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json` prints this machine's `HANDOFF.md` identity automatically;
  `CLAUDE.md`'s Recovery workflow gained a step 0 covering it. This machine's `.env` is set to
  `MACHINE_NAME=Laptop B` / `MACHINE_OWNER=Blair`.

### What's next

_Nothing queued. Awaiting new instructions._

### Open questions / blockers

_None._

## PC — third machine

_Not connected yet. Leave this section as-is until the machine is set up._

Setup notes for whoever brings it online:

- Cloning the repo brings the shared machinery with it — `.claude/settings.json` (the start-of-day,
  checkpoint and end-of-day hooks), skills, agents and commands all travel through git.
- Two things do **not** travel and must be done by hand on that machine:
  1. **`.env`** — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in. Generate a **new** Cloudflare API token
     for this machine at `dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens` rather than copying an existing one, so
     it can be revoked alone and the audit log stays per-machine. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is not a secret.
     `FIGMA_API_KEY` is a personal token — each person generates their own.
  2. **VS Code `git.autofetch`** — set it to `true` (Settings → search `git.autofetch`). Without it the
     status bar never shows the ↓ arrow when another machine has pushed.
